Thanks for checking out the site!

I should probably set the expectations right from the start: this blog will *not* be regularly updated. In fact, I will be genuinely shocked if I stick with this for more than a month or two. But in the off-chance that I do, here is what you might expect to find:

  * [`#rstats`](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typd&lang=en) tips
  * side-projects spun off from my work as a data analyst with [Futurewise](www.futurewise.org)
  * my thoughts on a variety of topics related to the focus of my studies and career: urban planning
  
My purpose is pretty simple: record my ideas somewhere where I can find them later, and if anyone else finds value in them that would be a nice bonus.

Stay tuned for fresh posts in the coming weeks.
