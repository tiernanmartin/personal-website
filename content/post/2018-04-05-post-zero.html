<div id="welcome" class="section level2">
<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Thanks for checking out the site!</p>
<p>I should probably set the expectations right from the start: this blog will <em>not</em> be regularly updated. In fact, I will be genuinely shocked if I stick with this for more than a month or two. But in the off-chance that I do, here is what you might expect to find:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en"><code>#rstats</code></a> tips</li>
<li>side-projects spun off from my work as a data analyst with <a href="www.futurewise.org">Futurewise</a></li>
<li>my thoughts on a variety of topics related to the focus of my studies and career: urban planning</li>
</ul>
<p>My purpose is pretty simple: record my ideas somewhere where I can find them later, and if anyone else finds value in them that would be a nice bonus.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for fresh posts in the coming weeks.</p>
</div>
